# 2048 (0x800)
A Chip8 implementation of the tile sliding game 2048.

## Controls
5: Slide tiles up  
7: Slide tiles left  
8: Slide tiles down  
9: Slide tiles right  
(This corresponds to the default WASD mapping in Octo and potentially other Chip8 emulators)

Pressing any other key will cause the buzzer to sound (indicating an invalid input) and the game will continue to wait for input.

## Game play
Each time a move is made tiles are moved to the specified direction, tiles which collide and have the same value are combined, then a new tile is spawned.
When an invalid move is made (leaving no free spaces for a new tile to spawn) the game ends and the buzzer sounds. No consideration is made for whether there
 were other valid moves available. The player may press any key to start again.

## Notes
The game runs best at 30 cycles/sec or faster. Below this speed it's slow to respond (probably a combination of drawing the whole screen each frame and the
 load/save when processing moves). This game only uses Chip8 instructions, not any of the SuperChip or Octo extensions.
